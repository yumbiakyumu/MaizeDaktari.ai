# Maize Daktari.ai

## Introduction

Maize Daktari.ai is a pioneering machine learning project focused on detecting and diagnosing maize diseases using computer vision and deep learning techniques. This project utilizes a tech stack including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, TensorFlow, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to provide accurate disease identification and detailed diagnoses for maize plants.

## Functionalities

### 1. Disease Detection
Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify various maize diseases from leaf images.

### 2. Disease Diagnosis
Providing detailed diagnoses and recommendations for detected diseases based on the analysis of symptoms.

### 3. Transfer Learning
Leveraging pre-trained models and transfer learning techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency.

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## PROJECT IS IN DEVELOPMENT BUT WILL BE FULLY ACCESSIBLE SOON
